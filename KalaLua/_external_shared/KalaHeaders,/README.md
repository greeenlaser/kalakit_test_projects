# KalaHeaders

Header-only scripts made in C++ 20 for various purposes. Completely self-dependant, unrelated to each other and can be used independently without dragging any of the other ones in.

## core_utils.hpp

Macros and cross platform import/export

- macros for __declspec/__attribute__/__stdcall for windows/linux api
- inline macros for forceinline and noinline
- deprecated macro
- debug assert macro (assertions are compiled out completely in release)
- shorthands for casters
- overrideable cross-platform templates for converting between uintptr_t and pointers/integrals/enums

### Templates

### File management

| Function              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| CreateFile            | Create regular or binary file at target path. If you also want data written to the new file after its been created then pass a fileData struct with one of the fields filled in, only the first found field data is used |
| CreateDirectory       | Create a directory at target path, this also creates all parent folders up to it that don't exist yet |
| ListDirectoryContents | List all the contents of a folder, with optional recursive flag |
| RenamePath            | Rename file or folder in its current directory |
| DeletePath            | Delete file or folder in target path (recursive for directories) |
| CopyPath              | Copy file or folder from origin to target, with optional overwrite flag |
| MovePath              | Move file or folder from origin to target, target is always overwritten if it already exists |

### File metadata

| Function             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| GetFileSize          | Get the size of the target file in bytes |

### Binary I/O

| Function                 | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| ReadBinaryBufferFromFile | Read raw binary data from a file into a buffer (up to bufferSize bytes). OutBytesRead returns the number of bytes read |

## log_utils.hpp

Comprehensive logger header for any logging needs - sends stdout and stderr messages to your console.

- can get current system time and date, formatted to chosen TimeFormat or DateFormat enum choice
- can set default time and date format so that TIME_DEFAULT and DATE_DEFAULT always use them with full Print function
- has full and basic Print functions

## Full and basic Print function differences
